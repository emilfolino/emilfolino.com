## Let's Encrypt och Certbot

When I created this site I never for one second wanted it to be without TLS as a HTTPS site. To do this I used the great work done by [Internet Security Research Group (ISRG)](https://letsencrypt.org/isrg/). I used [EFF's](https://www.eff.org/) amazing tool [Certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/) and after about 10 minutes of fiddling around with my domains I had a green lock in the URL bar. Compared to how much of a pain getting a certificate used to be [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) have saved the sanity of many developer.
