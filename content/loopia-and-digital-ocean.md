## Loopia and Digital Ocean

I use a [Loopia](https://loopia.se) as my registrar for the domain emilfolino.se. The last couple of days have been used for registration and changing the name servers. What I did was registrering a domain in my Digital Ocean droplet and then entering the Digital Ocean name servers in the Loopia customer zone. I then registered three A records in the Digital Ocean admin. One for emilfolino.se, www.emilfolino.se and lager.emilfolino.se. After a couple the changes worked for all three domains. Easy to use, but with a lot of waiting involved.
