## nginx
On the Digital Ocean droplet that this site runs on I use nginx to serve the static files alongside other side projects for example the [Lager API](lager.emilfolino.se) used in my course Webbapplikationer for mobila enheter at BTH (Web Applications for Mobile Devices).

I use the [H5BP](https://h5bp.github.io/) recommendations for caching and it is big part of why the site runs so fast.
