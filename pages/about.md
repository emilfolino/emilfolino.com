## About

My name is Emil Folino. I work at [Blekinge Tekniska HÃ¶gskola, BTH](https://bth.se) and mostly I teach in the Web Programming Cluster [dbwebb](https://dbwebb.se). I enjoy retweeting stuff at [Twitter](https://twitter.com/emilfolino).

My interests are the native technologies of the web and how we can create **fast**, **reliable** and **accessible** sites for the web. Humbly standing on the shoulders of the giants that came before. On this site I will try to share **Today I Learned** kind of articles, but it will probably be more like **The other day I learned this thing, but forgot to write about it, so here goes**.

I used to run really fast in woods, but nowadays it is mostly for fun.
